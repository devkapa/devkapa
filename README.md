ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nulfy

My name is Dev Kapadia, and I study at Penrith Selective High School.

I like to develop a variety of programs, usually for hobbies or as small projects for school. My programs are usually written in either Java, Python or JS.

I also play games, namely Valorant (currently Immortal 3) and previously Bedwars (500 stars).

You can find me on all my socials as @devkapa.
